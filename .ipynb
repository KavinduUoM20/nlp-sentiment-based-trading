And head to my office $SBUX on a pay as you go electric scooter that are littered around the streets. #basic The fact that this market is so nascent is confirmed by the fact that when bitcoin goes down everything goes down automatically  Even in a time when $BTC.D is below 50%   It doesn?\\u20ac?t make sense   It?\\u20ac?s as if when $AAPL goes down, all the stocks follow because it?\\u20ac?s the biggest I tried out $AAPL's new Apple Macbook Pro with the M1 Pro chip (10/16 core).

I think $AAPL $MSFT push through earnings this week and we?\\u20ac?ll start to see a rotation in the coming weeks @Soumyazen And $AAPL &amp; $AMZN $AAPL let's see the real run tomorrow Then again, it's quite comical to see investment legends like Warren Buffett buying shares in FANG like $AAPL 40 years after the founding on the basis of it being \\\"undervalued\\\".   You see that and can't help but think \\\"you gotta be shitting me?\\\" @Keubiko That kept me out of $AAPL, so fair's fair. @TheCeoMethod Any thoughts on $AAPL tomorrow? $AAPL earnings tomorrow. What we?\\u20ac?ve all been waiting for..???? Don't forget $TSLA earning tomorrow. Also $AAPL. Gonna be a crazy day $AAPL has an important earnings call tomorrow. I think this might be the first quarter ever that they post $100 billion in revenues? It will be interesting to see how market reacts to that. @Quarry_Rock there is one thing that would make $AAPL explode upside more than a car or VR headset unveiling:   if they changed their dividend payout ratio from 23% to something closer 50 % @amyhoy $AAPL Saga?! Is there a thread? ?????????\\u20ac $TSLA and $AAPL- Market expecting about 6% move on this, more like upside. $AAPL could be higher depending  on the revenue. Tomorrow's a big day for earnings calls. I've got my eyes on 3 companies:  1. AT&amp;T $T (before market open) 2. Apple $AAPL (after market close) 3. Tesla $TSLA (after market close) @WSBChairman $amc, $aapl and $tsla. Elon seems to be in good mood ???? I wanna see a trifecta tomorrow. $TSLA $AAPL $NIO pop. Until tomorrow ????

So much movement. Lots of money to be made. I HOPE YOU GET RICH @offlinespencer @Benzinga Possible. $AAPL ran up quite a bit before earnings, but its a coin flip. I personally would take the profits and let one or two contracts ride.  Or open a butterfly around the top of the expected move. $AAPL showing strength before ER. $FB as well.

Works for family, works for great companies like $TSLA &amp; $FUV.  Slow, steady growth over time, less stress, missing rally's.  Set it and forget it.  I shoulda done that with $AAPL in 07 when I saw the iPhone. @RTShark You?\\u20ac?re selling $AAPL? @BullRunTechs $AAPL always seems to crush earnings especially with the new phone. I expect ATH.

What will move $SPY tomorrow?: $AAPL $TSLA and #FOMC minutes.  Volatility is $$$ in my trading book.  #Banks and #Gold stocks are usually volatile on this day.  Watch them too @OptionsPastor $AAPL I spent 5K this quarter for IPhone so show me some bloody respect with earnings (3/4) I have a feeling this is only the beginning. Anyway! Today I bring you an incredibly frustrating green day recap via the two giants $TSLA &amp; $AAPL. As you can see one was a major loss &amp; the other a major win. You couldn't write this stuff ?????????\\u20ac??????????????? It is what it is. When I make @greatstockpicks @paulabinvest Yup, strong liquity in the markets currently. Hopefully feds don't change their tone and big companies hit lofty expectations. $aapl tomorrow Here's to my $aapl calls......maybe print enough to buy me an AAPL XDR display! @jsandlund While I understand the point about IPOs, it's not really the issue. $AAPL IPO'ed in 1980, not 1997. 100x just buying $GOOGL in 2009. Many examples.  Just owning a diversified portfolio of index funds handily beats wage &amp; price inflation, which is what retail investors should do. Is $AAPL priced in? Or does it make a move tomorrow? @JESSEBROWN30 $aapl for tomorrow ???????? @mattbigos $AAPL has the advantage of riding the laurels of Jobs?\\u20ac? success/demand for quality that generated unprecedented LEGACY cash flow,now being used to buy back shares at a horrific share price,so Cook is a zero innovation clown who is more of a financial engineer Taking requests for tomorrow on the World Series of Earnings.  What trade structure do you want to see for $AAPL They complained when Soft Bank bought options and gamma squeezed $AAPL and tech to the moon @3PeaksTrading Icic..I made my largest positions $AAPL and $SNAP as soon as netflix announced their earnings..hoping that $SNAP rewards me too $AAPL to $160 tomorrow after hours? I could see it happening. @jowens510 If it?\\u20ac?s easy money then why not buy and hold right now at $200? It could literally crash back to $50 any day. Investors are taking a risk purchasing $GME at these prices just as they would buy $AAPL at $143 @InvestmentTalkk Top tier management, one of the strongest brands in history, and like @jimish just said behavioral health is a known target. If anyone can make that mainstream, it would be $AAPL through their customer loyalty and cross selling $AAPL obviously it goes sub 140 after EZr. Why ppl think it will go 160? @jimcramer Lets make big tech $aapl run like $gme Earnings tmrw $aapl, $fb, $tsla @seowtk Yeah. Tomorrow through Monday will be fucking wild with Fed meeting, $AAPL $TSLA $FB, and this gamma unwind. I'm going long the thing the world is seemingly short. #GotVol? $aapl opening tomorrow at ATH get ready Big baller earnings come out tmrw... $TSLA $AAPL $FB Tomorrow is gonna be insane!! $AMC $AAPL $MSFT eps move having nice AH spillover to $AAPL and $AMZN @CNBCFastMoney How come the shows aren?\\u20ac?t company through on $AAPL podcasts? Is the show no longer in podcast form? So $GME is as valuable as $AAPL? Give me a f***ing break! I have $TSLA and $AAPL in the oven baking. I?\\u20ac?ll be cutting cake the rest of the month. ???????? #trading #APPLE #TESLA $AAPL One of my 2023 leaps went itm so I decided why not try out the PMCC strategy and take advantage of these inflated contract prices due to earnings. So I sold the $165 weekly and collected like $45 in premium. Played it very conservatively to try it out first. EOD Jan 27th will be looking for a sneaky $AAPL lotto call @InvestmentTalkk I do not have any $AAPL, but a ton of reasons to continue holding the stock IMO. Their hardware business and needs no introduction. Push to services should increase margins. Ton of cash. Demonstrated optionality, proven by watches and airpods. Pushing further into health. Surprised that an $AAPL watch can?\\u20ac?t detect if someone is having a heart attack, I would of thought they had that figured out by now. @EbsBestLife @OkeyoOptions Haha I?\\u20ac?m not! $AAPL is gonna make up for it???? Literally no one in equities spends their day attacking $AAPL holders because they hold $MSFT. How ridiculous does that sound?  But here, it's all a part of the online experience. @StockMKTNewz Buying more $AAPL and $AMD dip @ChartingOptions $AAPL should kill it just like $MSFT Hold $aapl through earnings? It?\\u20ac?s cheaper to get $AAPL than $GME and that?\\u20ac?s just wild to me @puppy_trades What do you think about holding a March $AAPL call through earnings? Can?\\u20ac?t wait to take profits tomorrow &amp; dump them into $AAPL &amp; enjoy the show ???? Cant wait to go to sleep.. too excited for tomorrow.. $AMC $AAPL $GME  @chamath @elonmusk @litcapital @daleadamson13 @StockDweebs They want to punish $GME for being a $10b company? That's pennies to a monster like $AAPL $AAPL $TSLA barely up a whopping 1% after $MSFT beat, baked in from here, major selloff in thu works after 2morrow @Dabraham1982 With all due respect...F*CK $AAPL.  $AMC ALL DAY @markminervini If you really believe $AMZN can get to 2000 and $AAPL can get to $70, why don't you short it? @grassosteve Steve I still like this name! If $AAPL earnings tomorrow show iPhone growth out of China then I think $CPRI  will do well. Chinese retails sales in general have been good. @SawyerMerritt Earnings week!  $msft already killed estimates..  $aapl and $tsla ready tomorrow. ???? @InvestmentTalkk $GME is obviously coming for $AAPL, right????? @InvestmentTalkk Betting on $AAPL to be a $3T company in 2yrs @nikovega99 Great sign for $AAPL ???????????? please do bits $AAPL ???? $NDX 13,700+ after $AAPL earnings wow corriendo $AAPL manteniendo los 155call ma??ana son los earnings. @ss_scalper I think $aapl does turn heads tmrw but how do you think stock will react? 11:11 AM EST, 01/26/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Apple $AAPL has an average outperform rating and price target range of $80 to $175????, according to analysts polled by Capital IQ. @ThiccTeddy My $MSFT and $AAPL calls to take me to the promised land @Pullman95736095 4-for-1 split on August 24 now 145$  means 580$ in 2014 it was 1-7 ... split, 42 years to 1 trillion but fools game 2 trillion soon 3 trillion in  fiat money printing $aapl @InvestmentTalkk M1 is the gamechanger! $AAPL So today:  Winners: $AMD winner - unless something happens will be a loser tomorrow or break even - +49% $NKLA - big winner - 120%, left runners, can keep going or backtest breakout $AAPL - winner - 7%, up AH, be surprised if doesn't hold or go higher in the AM $AAPL thru 144.3 rips Can?\\u20ac?t help but marvel at and comment on #GameStop $GME #GME. With no news, it?\\u20ac?s traded $3B in value in after market, about 3x $aapl... which announces earnings tomorrow! $AAPL $150 fo4 sure @InvestmentTalkk 30% gravy $AAPL gets from the app store and, oh yea, airpods ~35% mkt share, iwatch ~55% market share...$AAPL just keeps on coming out with products people must have..a monster on so many levels @Stage2Stocks @markminervini Probably right. Huge reason I bought FB last yr was their $ pile n cash flow. One thing I'll add $AAPL seem to be focused on increasing margin n buybacks. Just do the math if they used their cash to buy back stock???????? @DontFeedBear Well at least there's my $AAPL calls... With $AAPL earnings tomorrow and $BB on the rise... No point in riding that for two days @ShantanuPrasa15 @InvestmentTalkk Yup, $AAPL on DRIP @InvestmentTalkk Huge capital gains taxes is my primary reason to keep holding $AAPL  It's one of the companies I've in the set it &amp; forget it mode  Not adding to it, so over time, the position in my portfolio will become smaller  + Know your 'cows' &amp; 'horses' in your portfolio. $AAPL is a cow @Stdbd123 @AtlasAlphaTrade $AAPL will kick butt tomorrow AH. +5% index weight. Buying $GME at $220 or $AAPL at $144 ???????????????????????? ... life is hard sometimes ???? I know yall love $GME but $AAPL is half the price :) @georgeinthecord EXACTLY meanwhile I?\\u20ac?m playing $aapl earnings @Lowkey__3 I got one for the week it wasn?\\u20ac?t too expensive, $AAPL earnings gonna clear any losses from this week. can you guys pump $aapl too??? @BearingtonTrade same scenario might happen tomorrow:  $aapl beat earnings, prolly up 5% after-hours $amc will be up 15% after-hours @bound2fuckup Sold at the top then hopped into $200 calls. Currently holding. Tomorrow will be a good day lol.   I played $AAPL Er as well. @InvestmentTalkk It?\\u20ac?s a great stock and I think it will do well.  I recently sold my small position in $AAPL but not because I thought it was a bad investment, I just had other stocks that I thought would do better. $AAPL:  Stay at home orders, Christmas break, personal savings at the highest level, no restaurants, American consumers, flashy 5G phones from Apple....a perfect storm!!  Looking forward to the earnings. @DereckCoatney All in on $AAPL calls @ColumbiaJoanna In most cases... its purely a numbers issue. Anything &gt;5000 contracts merits it... although need &gt;10/20k for the giants like $AAPL $MSFT $TSLA Earnings for $AAPL tomorrow. What should we be expecting? $AAPL cant break the 144.50..why??????????????? @tsunaminvesting $Amc  $aapl maybe $lumn $AAPL soars tomorrow ???? Soo what?\\u20ac?s everybody?\\u20ac?s take on $AAPL earnings? Whack holiday season + transition to M3 miss? People getting rich off $GME while im sitting here holding good companies like $aapl and $nio ???? lol congrats tho Where does everyone think $AAPL will be after earnings ? ???? Large Print $AAPL Size: 575224 Price: 143.16 Time: 1714 Amount: $82,349,067.84 Like to get a couple buck out of $AAPl in the morning then sell all of that too.   sold half my WWR shares, sold my PSTH shares. @DereckCoatney WOW $AAPL is the real deal, it's still under a PE of 100 ???? On a more serious note, they really have to destroy expectation, because they are really close to a PS ratio of 10 and we all remember @scottmcnealy's quote right? @RedDogT3 @RedDogT3 good sign for $AAPL tomorrow? What a crazy market week and $TSLA &amp; $AAPL report earnings tomorrow ???????????????????? @DMsteadyGrowth @quithian Dude if you really think $GME is having a higher market cap than $AAPL just because their share price is higher, you may want to quit trading now @Jack25433732 Even tho i say that i do think $aapl will steal the show tomorrow. @EllleDe I got $AMC and $FUBO AND $AAPL calls   And commons.  I like this list A lot of rookie traders are going to lose a lot of money from $GME... no way their share price should be almost double $AAPL .... insanity @longdongtrader I day trade everyday &amp; rarely hold overnight. I skied today, so no trades. But I have real concern that we are going to correct rn. Waiting for retail to grow tired. Which should be Thursday/Friday.... Will probably enter $AAPL tomorrow. And may hold $AMZN through ER. Or 0dt FD's I'll be selling these $AAPL calls tomorrow, I'd imagine we get a ramp, but I'm not doing earnings again, never ceases to amaze me  $AMD nothing short of amazing results w/ even better guidance and can't catch a bid  Can't say I'm surprised, but still, it's a friendly reminder @OphirGottlieb When in Rome. See a little fed liquidity goes along way. I think $AAPL is do for a raise, it's been a few month :) @ShareKhan2020 Sold $fsly today. Long $aapl however its extended... i was thinking 150 for $aapl and its very close to that now. I do think 180-200 is possible by end of yr @CRyanSchadel I would roll all my profits into $AAPL tomorrow. @elonmusk Say something nice about $AAPL and take me out of poverty pls hhhhaha @CitronResearch please short $AAPL @elonmusk Next pop is $AAPL ???\\u20ac But if you did sell $AAPL and buy $GME..... @AppleThisApple1 Thoughts on how this will this affect Apple? $AApl GameStop $GME is worth more than Apple $AAPL and is close to Microsoft $MSFT in regards to stock prices. It's gotta be one of the most expensive failing companies out there. @durantcapital @DontFeedBear I've not had good luck trading $AAPL in the past, nor $AMD.  If you've got a strat that works with $AAPL, would love to read about it. @richard_chu97 @Soumyazen What?\\u20ac?s their moat? No concerns of $AAPL or $GOOG interfering? Such high GM usually attracts competitors. @AntonHand $aapl earnings tomorrow, time to take profit and buy more gamestonk $AAPL and $MSFT are worth $4.2 trillion and I have zero idea what that means $AAPL hits 150 tomorrow? @DontFeedBear $AMD and $AAPL are both in the \\\"do not trade\\\" bin for me  I am long both.  No trade.  Just own. @nicktrader5 I'm leaning yes for $TSLA, 50/50 $AAPL $AAPL closed today at $143.16.  If you bought 1 share of #AAPL at its closing price every day this week, you?\\u20ac?ve gained $0.24 (+0.08%).  If you bought 1 share of AAPL at its closing price every day this year, you?\\u20ac?ve gained $173.97 (+8.22%). @timothysykes @sttbreakingnews $GME trading at a higher price action than $AAPL... Massive!!! Playing earnings for the first time, pray for my account ????????   $AMD $TSLA $AAPL @HETorresJr I think I'll stick with $MSFT and $AAPL ???? @FlosserInvest Don?\\u20ac?t count out big tech  $AMZN $FB $AAPL yet to report I have some kind of bias favouring Microsoft $MSFT.   No idea why. It?\\u20ac?s the earnings report I look forward to the most. Maybe I admire Bill Gates too much.   It?\\u20ac?s not my largest position. I?\\u20ac?ve made a lot more money with $AAPL, $GOOG and others. $GOOGL Should fly this week if $AAPL and especially $FB kill it tomorrow . @elonmusk Is Warren Buffett selling $AAPL to buy $GME now?  Speculation is insane especially when $TSLA Q4 is tomorrow.

Large Print $AAPL Size: 161000 Price: 142.92 Time: 1449 Amount: $23,010,120.00 It's a bit ironic that here, in Silicon Valley, you have countless investors chasing 100x winners, and yet if you had just bought $AAPL at an average price in 1997, you would have a 1000x return by now.

I have a mindset now that I would love to own products like an Apple Watch... but until I make $500 with $aapl to pay for it I?\\u20ac?m not going to ???? $AAPL And guess what, there will be at least 10 more people asking when earnings are between now and earnings time  tomorrow. LOL $GME could blow up to $1,000/share or go bankrupt within the next week. However, this cannot shift the broader market &amp; majority of retail investors. $TLSA &amp; $AAPL, two of top 5 S&amp;P500 holdings, bear much more meaning to financial markets.

The wait for $AAPL Earnings has me sick. Tables been set all we need is food to eat @markminervini Precisely.  As I've said for years, innovation at $aapl died with Steve Jobs.

Signify diagonal or a bigger bullish move perhaps to 175. $msft earnings:  lifts it with $aapl to more new big $FANG &amp; stuff highs?  $9 trillion ain't enough for Big 6. $AAPL easy money, I added more shares @Modubatse Yep. Makes me worried for the holders of ?\\u20ac?exciting?\\u20ac? companies like $TSLA $AAPL.   I think a log of the $2,000 checks, $600 checks, and new Biden checks are making it into the market and into these stocks  All by newbie investors $aapl  ????  Apple   $145.00   Royal Bank of Canada.  buy If $AAPL is ?\\u20ac?just a computer company?\\u20ac?, as many used to foolishly claim with a market cap now of over 2.4T, why is it so hard to see $TSLA at 834B with cars, custom computers, a charging network, solar energy generation? $AAPL any sellers so I can buy the dip? Haha ???? @markminervini I kind of get the point you are trying to make but it seems a lot of saltiness towards Apple. I just wonder if you bought $aapl but missed out on $bb recently. At the other end of the spectrum, #Apple enjoyed a solid day, adding 2.8% in the run-up to what is expected to be a record-setting set of results this week. $AAPL $AAPL if it dips to 140 I?\\u20ac?ll get myself a contract. I love the volatility here ! Actually buy from the stocks you're invested in.  Invested in $NKE? That's where i'm buying  Invested in $AAPL? That's where i'm buying I'm actually nervous about $TSLA and $AAPL earnings report tomorrow. I know they will kill it but the market is looking for reasons to pop. Even a modest forecast/guidance could set off . $AAPL if GME can go to 160 why not Apple go to 300 ? @chamath Steady growth coming from $ASML the next few years, world leader selling the best chip making machines to the likes of $AAPL and $TSM I think Apple should seriously be focused on Smart Home systems instead of cars, it?\\u20ac?s losing its throne to Amazon in the Smart era.  $aapl $tsla $AAPL Artificial intelligence caught some really great trades in AAPL. Ai generated trailing stop-loss is updated on the chart. $AAPL would love a dip on this towards 138-139 to go long.   $NFLX should hold 550 for going back to post ER highs. @Serv_N_Folly @markminervini Yes, I disagree with Mark here. He seems to have an axe to grind with $AAPL. I am not a shareholder, just an observer... @DavisTrades played $AAPL on the bounce from the vol profile. Great weekend lesson of yours on YT. very timely ;) @pakiunicorn @JoeBiden Oh nah, I?\\u20ac?m not crazy enough to play $TSLA earnings ???? hopped in 5 contracts on $AAPL tho ???\\u20ac @mpatel79 All of them were started in 2019 or earlier  $EXAS 2015 $AAPL 2013 $NVDA 2017  159% YTD in 2020 $AAPL is expected to reach a $3 trillion capitalization in the next 12 months.  ???? ?\\u20ac?

Investing mistakes can be your greatest teacher but buying a stock because ?\\u20ac?you saw a article on the news ?\\u20ac? is by far the dumbest shit I?\\u20ac?ve ever done &amp; heard . The one time i did do it ,it worked in my favor &amp; that stock was $AAPL for my son . #BeingaDumbAssIsYourChoice @chamath $spot - dominating audio, huge/growing industry, counter positioned against $aapl with ads @chamath $SNE valuation ex cash is extremely enticing. Gaming revenue is exploding 30-40%+ y/y. PS5 could end up being best selling console ever. Buying $SNE today is akin to buying $AAPL in 2013.

What is there to lose? $Aapl would sink if they acquire $tsla??? I think not, quite the opposite actually. Keep in mind: The Market DOES NOT CARE about your feelings. $aapl $twtr @Keubiko Some would call this irony, others will call it natural order of things when social media completely falls over.  Thank god i have $MSFT and $AAPL We going short on $TWTR $FB and $AAPL on Monday, or nah? @misfitpoise You can only hang your opponents if you have them. Then you hang each other. Censorship converges on a less socially influential platform. Why? B/c ppl overwhelmingly don?\\u20ac?t actively use, or even have Twitter. Ultimately becomes message board. I?\\u20ac?m more concerned about $GOOG, $AAPL Shifted $AAPL to $NIO.  Even if it does 10% of what $TSLA did, will be laughing. #TrumpBanned 1 Apple Park Way in Cupertino, California, United States. $aapl Thoughts on Hyundai &amp; Apple partnership? $AAPL Big Tech's \\\"Friday Night Massacre\\\"  #SM #Media  $AAPL  $GOOGL  $FB So if we are doing this..

Because I'm very confident that $TSLA will not be volatile for the next 10 years, and will go more like $AAPL and $AMZN did long term. I'm selling all of my Apple stock.  $AAPL This will end badly for our tech overlords  $aapl $googl $fb $TWTR stock will plummet! I personally will be shorting the shit out of it first thing Monday morning via puts! They will lose half their customers in the blink of an eye.  Jack really is that stupid. $SQ is next! Along with $AAPL. $FB $TWTR and $AAPL are losing credibility by taking such blatant partisan action against Trump.  And you still think Section 230 protections should be given to social media companies? Everybody should dump TWITTER and FACEBOOK stocks and stop buying Apple products.  These companies need to go under.  $FB $TWTR $AAPL @elonmusk - it?\\u20ac?s time! Only you can release a new OS &amp; hardware for mobile to give censored America a non communist option other than Google &amp; Apple. You are the only one who can do it fast! Apple just killed their long standing reputation as the safe option! $AAPL Hahahaha $GOOGL removes parler from App Store. $AAPL will do it next. @reddit banned Trump. @Twitter banned Trump. @Facebook silenced Trump. ????????????????  Q will have to head back to 4chan. Maybe resorting back to pornhub comment section to communicate. This is freaking hilarious. @afdestruction @thomasbethke @michaelbatnick $KO would not be my stock of choice. Preferably $AAPL and $MSFT which I mentioned before. Is it not the ultimate irony that $goog and $aapl are like under investigation for the power their app stores wield and they just used it to shut down an app, but that action will be fine and might even win them brownie points with the new regulators? If I am $AAPL, I will not take @parler_app from the App Store. One reason and one reason only, it means big portion of that 80M will buy iPhones instead of Android. @GerberKawasaki @tim_cook I already put in my sell order for $AAPL   This attack on Free Speech must stop!!!

Social Media is much stronger than opioids. You're fucking addicted. You cannot leave this shit.   You just cannot.   And $AAPL and $GOOG made phones that ensure you cannot leave either.

I know there?\\u20ac?s a lot of talk about $TWTR and $FB but honestly $AAPL threatening @parler_app is the wildest one imo @magicmiketrader How pathetic $aapl is ever in picking who to partner with or acquire. The only right thing they ever did was getting Steve Jobs back. Even cheap shit korean brand don?\\u20ac?t want nothing to do with you. Go back to make phone, CHEAPER phones with charger. @yashar @RMac18 @JohnPaczkowski So let's drop $AAPL as well...

There is a psychological component to a split that makes the stock appear more ?\\u20ac?growthy?\\u20ac?.  $AMZN should have split shares back when $TSLA and $AAPL did.  The math of it doesn?\\u20ac?t matter, the optics do. Jan 08 Friday, $AAPL $131.55  Bullish target $132.88 Bullish target $138.94 Jan 08 Friday, $AAPL HIGH is $132.63 and hit Bullish target $130.49 ???? Hyundai flying cuz of $AAPL news... they may partner with them on apple EV ... $GOEV has a deal with Hyundai also ???\\u20ac???\\u20ac???\\u20ac $AAPL showing a sideway's trend moving in a channel of $132 Resistance and $130 Support , Buy dips at $130 Sell Resistance at $ 132 , play as long as fun last's , take positions on breakout of channel accordingly. @EricBalchunas @awealthofcs @TikTokInvestors To fair I did clarify saying covered calls on $aapl and $msft are the way to achieve this. 3x levered etfs are a construct of financial firms whose business model is to generate fees. @beyourself200 ???????????????? long $AAPL plus i have a trading position (added into weakness this week). Other positions --&gt; raised cash will be adding into weakness late next week (seasonal weakness, if we get it this year). $AAPL lagging QQQ .. on the EV news @TicTocTick now now $aapl $tsla $amzn  #FridayMotivation #FridayVibes #FridayFeeling #fridaynightfunkin #FridayThoughts #fridaymorning #FridayFitness #fridaynightfunkinfanart  Friday Fun ! Did Humans discover new source of energy AND Aliens?  or Are they just trying to? Fuck it had to cash out on $AAPL If Apple teams up with fucking HYUNDAI I?\\u20ac?m selling all my $AAPL stock. What a joke 08 January '21 1/2 $NVDA P530 -8,6% a bit unlucky here, because later on it did exactly what I was anticipating (good idea, bad timing)  $AAPL P131 +47,5% - only 2 targets were hit, with majority of my position closed above BE  Almost +$3,9k in profits in total  HAGW #DayTrading I would love to see $AAPL fucking RUN next week. #TimApple shallow shorts pockets are responsible for over half of the cracked iPhones in America.   not one for conspiracy theories, but starting to get the feeling that clothing companies are colluding with @tim_cook &amp; the Apple repair department to help their bottom line $AAPL $NKE. I?\\u20ac?m trimming from my big cap tech $aapl $goog $amzn Intrigued by the $goev Hyundai relationship with $aapl lurking in the background. Solid chart set up too. Also in some $AAPL calls.. targeting that 133.61 high from Monday. @cbdidthat I get Bitcoin, don't Get $TSLA I've seen this movie before, take a look at the $CSCO chart long term, it's still not back to 2000 levels (And they delivered on EVERYTHING) TSLA is a pipe dream with competitors coming in the space every day $AAPL They're already priced 4 whole mkt $ford and $aapl making the FAPPLE car 2025 #calls #OptionsTrading When is $TSLA going to buy $AAPL? @elonmusk I've been avoiding FAANG names + some momo names. Will continue unless I see proper rotation. Only name of interest is $AAPL if so. $AAPL  was good on hrly but now $TSLA is the only one on hrly @calvinfroedge When you put it that way, $AAPL seems cheap as dirt right now! $AAPL getting closer to taking off my short JAN 140C and short MAR 100P income trades while continuing to hold the underlying. Waiting for a mid day entry at support for $AAPL to swing over the weekend. @DavisMartin88 @michaelbatnick Just look at the covered call premiums on $aapl and $msft. I know implied vol has been high this past year but it?\\u20ac?s definitely possible and high level money managers know this. @ReverendJLK That?\\u20ac?s where people fail. They fall in love with the stock and only play it one way.  $aapl is the same way @ParikPatelCFA I find it pretty sad that more than half of $BRK is composed of $AAPL. Sounds like lack of ability to research innovation, and dependency on riding coat tails. New Options trade update:  $AAPL Sold Feb 19 $120 P Bought Feb 19 $115 P Total Credit: $100 per spread 20% return  Thoughts? @p_ferragu #Apple can buy #Hyundai tomorrow w cash and have everything needed to mass produce EVs.  Most carmakers are at best takeover targets for vehicle engineering and manufacturing capacity if not Branding.  $aapl $tsla @squawksquare This is a trillion dollar stock. $TSLA &gt; $AAPL $AAPL with the stick save.  At least we now know where the downside risk is located. Going to let the theta burn away and see if I can come up with a good 2x-5x option play for last 2 hrs of today.  Probably will be $AAPL but let us see how things develop. Wake me up when $TSLA has a larger EV vs. $AAPL I got out of that $AAPL short a while ago, didn't get to 130 exactly.  I think towards end of day might be able to do the same trade again.  Not sure if I will do it again. Join @rfaloona and @TTBlackBox for a FREE webinar TODAY (1/8) at NOON est  Talking about $AAPL, $TSLA, EVs, Cannabis, and more! via @Benzinga roll down $aapl to 130c @psqnt How can we just keep buying $AAPL if there?\\u20ac?s a fixed amount? $AAPL red but not red enough @MisterRahool $Aapl wants to compete with $Tsla ???? $AAPL you suck Things got pretty euphoric this week.   Notable weakness in $AMZN and $AAPL   Not a top caller, but bears may be making some dents here. I always wondered how people missed out on $AAPL , but constantly seeing the pure ignorance surrounding $TSLA for a few years now, it makes perfect sense. Throw $AMZN in there too. Why can?\\u20ac?t $AAPL keep the same energy? @Teslarati @ResidentSponge @JJODRY While $AAPL needs to wait until 2024 to have a Hyunday Apple Car.   $AAPL now is a bad copycat. @vedvarma Blocking ads on native apps in mobile devices is non-trivial.  $GOOG doesn't want you do it, since they stop making money; $AAPL doesn't let you do it, since they don't think you own the iPhone.  Setting a network-level adblocker such as @NextDNS or #PiHole fixes that somewhat. $TLSA +7% today. At this rate it will be bigger than $AAPL in another 15 trading sessions. Fully diluted, more like 10 sessions. Got out at breakeven on $AAPL. Not liking this. Quick trade on $ROKU 1/8 425C 0.42 to 0.58. Small gains due to volatility. Typical Fri expiration effect. @Per_Fin_Monkey $aapl at $98 per share. I remember analysts saying it was high then. That was two splits ago. ???? $DDOG long call + 100 $AAPL long call - 22 $AAPL is struggling today. Didn't expect that. They are trying to get $SPY over 381. Still holding $SPY and $AAPL calls. Will be stacking up more $NIO and $AAPL It's going to be the EVs and Biotechs market this year. Not forgetting Robotics, Energy and AI. Lots of stupid custom appliance-like consumer devices. $AAPL &amp; $MSFT eventual captured pretty much that entire market. I think the right way to think about an automobile is as an environment filled with various gadgets. These gadgets are made by a wide array of companies. @JTSEO9 got me thinking about $aapl, and why they are talking with $HYMTF.   What occurred to me is that we are at a moment in time that is very reminiscent of the early days of personal computers. Back then it was all about gadgets. Anyone remember the Sharper Image? @MichaelMcGaughy The same reason companies like $AAPL raise cash via issuing bonds when they already have plenty of cash on hand: they can earn more with the cash than it costs to borrow, so why not take advantage and lock it in at historically low rates? Who needs coffee when you have $AAPL calls. Bout shit myself before 7 am @petenajarian + 20.76% on a short-dated $AAPL put! Just a #SCHWING'ing #GiddyUp little doggie, #Rawhide $AAPL goes more red Im buying $AAPL about to go red for the morning $AMZN continuing red from yesterday's close $UNH following the dip down @LuoshengPeng Apple is the wrong ticker.

In a perfect world Tesla would make the Apple car and it would be a solid collaboration of design and tech. Bullish on both companies! $TSLA $AAPL In a perfect world Tesla would make the Apple car and it would be a solid collaboration of design and tech.   @elonmusk would that even be something you would consider?  $AAPL $TSLA @Apple @Tesla $AAPL JAN 8 2021 132.0 Call at .89 Bought $aapl 08JAN21 132.00c $AAPl calls 145C are lit @BandmanMalachi1 $AAPL $WMT $ABNA $BIDU close to ATHs premarket on EV news with $AAPL Huge Print $AAPL Size: 1105552 Price: 132.5 Time: 930 Amount: $146,485,640.00 @jeffwills08 I?\\u20ac?ve always wondered why $AAPL didn?\\u20ac?t enter this market, but then again Tim Cook is a follower instead of an innovator imo. Apple Inc. ( $AAPL )??is reportedly unlikely to plan an upgrade to its iPhone camera lenses until 2023 Need to dump some $AAPL tbh. $STM w/ a 6% rev beat- some currency boost prob but $AAPL supply chain strength worst kept secret... $SPY $TSLA $AAPL Warren Buffet asks, ?\\u20ac?If you don?\\u20ac?t follow KansasCash, can you really call yourself a success in life??\\u20ac? @CNBC @TradingNation That dude is going to be buying back those calls quickly when $AAPL is over $150 by the end of Jan 21..... Apple ( $AAPL ) reportedly partnered with Honda ( $HMC ) for its self-driving car, although it has walked back its confirmation saying it is in talks with \\\"potential partners\\\" while removing references to Apple (AAPL) New swing trades $AAPL  $MSFT @TheMarkCooke To some, $PTON is just a bike (hardware) co with some fancy add ons and a misinformed cult following...sounds a lot like $TSLA and $AAPL in their early yrs..I put more in my kids Roth IRA?\\u20ac?s this wk. kudos to you, you?\\u20ac?ve been rock solid on this name! @zerohedge $aapl ATH coming @girdley $AAPL 300/share next 5 years, $TSLA 1000/share next 3 months ?????\\u20ac??????? NEWS 01/08/2021: $AAPL ?\\u20ac? automaker Hyundai Motor is walking back earlier confirmation of electric car talks with Apple, saying it was in talks with ?\\u20ac?potential partners?\\u20ac? Its comments follow reports that the two were discussing a joint venture involving electric cars and batteries. @Besni121 $AAPL have a deal with Hyundai now for EV cars and Hyundai is working with Canoo on it! $GOEV. Warrents are up 15% already today! @AlternateJones I think there are three horses in that race ( $tsla $aapl $amzn ) - with a winner by the end of 2022 #tesla #3trillion #marketcap It's a stock Pumpers Market right now.  I don't care if it's $TSLA, $AAPL, BITOIN, CYRTO's, Penny Stocks.  Pumpers are in total control of the stock market so go with the Pumpers. @h_pundit @mraveragetrader @alphacharts365 Yes. $AAPL was still working within its base &amp; below the 137.98 pivot, whereas $DIS (assuming you meant Fri, 12/11) was breaking out into new highs. Context of the daily chart should help. New highs, trendline breaks, pattern breakouts, support bounces will have better success. 3/ Apple has risen 200%+ from that trough of $700bn with active managers upping their weighting closer to benchmark   From an active weighting and market cap standpoint, we are now in similar market territory with Tesla. HODL . $TSLA $AAPL $AAPL + $HYMTF report?  Hyundai OTC is $HYMTF which of course looks unchanged this morning  Dont forget OTC are not traded after hours  So what happened?  Hyundai is Korean &amp; trades on KRX. Ticker is 005380  Reports walk back the claim but Hyundai board already made $2B overnight $AAPL loves to lead the way and it looks really lovely this morning.  If it can build above $132.25 it has room back to the big highs. @G_sin128 Useful stuff George, following as a long term investor myself. Interested to know if you hold S&amp;P500 as well as individual stocks such as the likes of $TSLA $AAPL etc or diversify outside of that? Or if you?\\u20ac?d look for an alternative ETF to balance in future? Really starting to think $TSLA may not stop until it?\\u20ac?s competing with $AAPL for the largest market cap. Hyundai says in early talks with Apple after electric vehicle tie-up report  $AAPL @from100kto1m @elon @elonmusk Not only on twitter. Every appearance. And he's killing it. Musk's personal brand value is probably somewhere near that of $aapl. Without him $tsla wouldn't be trading at 10% of the current price $aapl if you playing apple for EVs you must own $goev read below: Apple eying a deal with Hyundai and Canoo $goev are the partners of Hyundai EV development. $AAPL  set up really good for earnings Even if $AAPL invented an iPhone that never had to be charged (ever), would that justify $AAPL increasing to a $20 Trillion valuation? That is the current concept with $TSLA valuation. @Harmbrit $AAPL will be one of the first stocks I buy in Spring when I get back to work from my 3 month vacation. @DCDOWORK $AAPL after today I don?\\u20ac?t see any stop .. ???? Every dip will be bought $AAPL @PeterGhostine today $133+ ???? for sure $AAPL What if $AAPL will join automotive industry? $TSLA Seeing this $AAPL and Hyundai holding collaboration talks on electric vehicles, adding that Hyundai collaborated with $GOEV to use their technology in electric vehicles, and this mornings strength in GOEV, I now see why someone was bidding on 120k warrants the other day. where is $AAPL n EV buying? $AAPL Apple and Hyundai in talks over electric vehicle partnership I hate this BS! $AAPL Twitter Sentiment on 7 Jan 2021 was: ??? Positive 42.2% ??? Negative 12.1% ??? Neutral 45.7% ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? $AAPL confirmed in talks with Hyundai to build EVs. New target $230. @FT_Trades I think we?\\u20ac?ll see the $134+ intraday $AAPL Go Tim! @Sandro_power $TSLA $AAPL great option plans, daily grind $AAPL closed $130.92  $AAPL is $132.42 in the premarket ??????? @UdallTechStrat I tried last night on the $AAPL headline...honey badger $TSLA doesn't care about $AAPL car. So $HYMTF and $AAPL... No one guessed that one ???? @LanceRoberts @TopGunFP $AAPL, $TSLA, $BTC @realJuicytradez Give me one today and I sign up Monday. $TDOC $FUBO $AAPL...something else?? $AAPL liking this through 133 for 135 @Exodus27442502 New ATH incoming $AAPL @DavidBCollum $AAPL is trading at $189k per iPhone sold in 2008. What?\\u20ac?s point? (2.2T / 11.63mm) @Waviehall As far as I know, lidar is already becoming an ancient technology. I forget what the name of the new tech is called for AV's but it's far more reliable than lidar. I imagine $AAPL is working on that tech, if not alone, then with partners. @jimcramer $AAPL &amp; $FSR?? what ya think Jimmy chill? prob a good segment opener for today @WallStJesus Maybe $aapl will do the trick and degrade some big ones in the automotive industry to step back and act as a purely supplier/ producer to them. Volkswagen/Hyundai could produce different apple car models and may be the new foxconn. @carlquintanilla Welcome to sell-side research ???? These charts are useless. Yes assets go through bubble and bust cycles but some can be under-priced for long periods of time. To wit: $aapl $amzn $tsla. #Bitcoin is in a new bull/price discovery cycle. #storeofvalue #digitalgold \\\"Shares of Hyundai Motor surged 19% after the South Korean automaker said it was in early-stage talks with Apple over potentially working together to develop an electric car.\\\" ???? Apple doesn't usually like potential partners to talk about unreleased products... $AAPL #Investment portfolio is up 30% YTD ????   Many thanks to $TSLA $AAPL ????????  Follow me for the journey from here on, where we will beat that growth ???? Does anyone on here have shares in $TSLA or $AAPL stocks? Buying what you use and believe in is powerful.   For many of us, $AAPL would be a clear example.   If you do this instead of buying the new iPhone, the future you will thank you.   #Growth #personalfinance So Hyundai getting into the Electric car Mkt with $AAPL (yet another competitor) and $TSLA still goes up?? @JoeSquawk @PatternProfits @mraveragetrader @alphacharts365 Wow! Wasn't expecting a response, super kind of you Ben.  I stick with large liquid names, so maybe $AAPL on 22 Dec (Gap and Fade) vs $DIS on 13 Dec (Gap n Go)  Saw your videos, starting to appreciate how I need to incorporate Daily Chart analysis into my day trades - any tips? $AAPL &amp; $TSLA brought me $900 in a week $LAC $21.75 on Level 2 ask, no top in sight, GLTA  #lithium $tsla $Aapl #HOFstock @jimcramer For me it?\\u20ac?s like $AAPL..own it, don?\\u20ac?t trade it. @Reuters Apple car project started in 2014, only now they secured a battery for the car, that too for production in 2027.... and people are excited about it.... oh Apple how you miss deadlines and still fool Wallstreet..... $AAPL  @business @Reuters @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC @CNBC @WSJ $AAPL SC alerts team swing looking tasty way to start a Friday off ???\\u20ac??????? #StocksToWatch #DayTrading #options #optionstrading Because of Bitcoin and $TSLA and $AAPL etc etc stc.

I can understand creating different products to serve two opposite spectrums of the market, but Apple's tryna do it wrapped up in one ???????????? @asymmetricbets Lol ???? Because $aapl knows Tesla for what it is a scam company @jimcramer I?\\u20ac?ve been long $AAPL since 2012 my senior year high school ????????, enjoyed $700 ATH , &amp; 2 splits (7/1 &amp; recently 4/1) ???? #Apple will release Q1 earnings on January 27 after market close.

I?\\u20ac?m long on $AAPL rn. @gabrielkaplan @heartof_thesea @east_cap I think it's less of $AAPL building a search engine from scratch, but more of a defensive move against $MSFT Bing. The lead that $GOOG has over its competitors in search will only widen over time - not so much its market share, but its stickiness and algo superiority So, $AAPL and $HYMTF Hyundai are teaming up...  Why not $TSLA?  Probably because Tesla doesn?\\u20ac?t need THEM.
